Hey, I'm Vanta. It's been a long time since I made a post like this, so here goes.

If you don’t already know, I have people in my do-not-interact list. One of those people is a person online (specifically Roblox and TikTok) named Bruddas.

Now I want to talk about what Bruddas and his friends did.

Bruddas and his friends started harassing me and my younger brother in real life, who is 15 and will be 16, starting in September 2025. They stalked my brother and my social media, even joining every Roblox game we were in.

Why, you may ask?

Because my friend made one mistake six years ago, and these guys did not let it go.

Now, from what I have seen and heard from my brother, one of Bruddas’ friends said to my brother that he was going to seduce my younger sister and me into dating him. Keep in mind that my sister is 12, and the guy is around my age. This friend, whom we will call D, said that he was going to make my younger sister, whom we will call M, into a kitten of his. My sister M already has a boyfriend, and D said that he was going to kill him, comfort M, and be her boyfriend so that he will not get out of our lives.

D and Bruddas also kept leaking my friend’s name into my TikTok comments section. My messages are set to friends only and are kept that way until they stop stalking me. They are also impersonating my friend on social platforms like Roblox, etc.

Bruddas has stalked me to the point where he knows my full legal name, something I have never told friends, let alone stalkers. Even D knows it; he referred my brother via our family name. He sent me a friend request on Facebook, a platform I rarely check, but it has my full name.

My friend has already made a police report on them, but unfortunately, the police here are severely underpaid to the point that they don’t want to do their job. It’s on the news that someone tried making a domestic violence report on their partner, and it was only 2 years later that they were found dead by their partner because the police did nothing.

D is also stalking my friends, specifically on TikTok, telling them to tell me to talk to them about my friend. Of course, my friends are smart, and they tell me about it.

If you happen to be my friend and are currently a victim of these people, I am so sorry for even being your friend in the first place; you did nothing to get the harassers. The only reason they are targeting you is because of me.
